"""Background script: compute cross-contributor record matches after data import.

Optimised for large datasets (millions of records, hundreds of contributors):
- Pure SQL INSERT...SELECT — no Python roundtrip for match rows
- Parallel workers — multiple contributors processed concurrently
- SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED — safe concurrent job claiming
- Per-session work_mem — lets PostgreSQL use in-memory hash joins

Usage:
    docker compose exec api python tools/compute_matches.py [--workers N]

Triggered automatically by import_to_db.py; can also be run via trigger_matches.py.
