"""Background script: compute cross-contributor record matches after data import.

Optimised for large datasets (millions of records, hundreds of contributors):
- Pure SQL INSERT...SELECT — no Python roundtrip for match rows
- Parallel workers — multiple contributors processed concurrently
- SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED — safe concurrent job claiming
- Per-session work_mem — lets PostgreSQL use in-memory hash joins

Usage:
    docker compose exec api python tools/compute_matches.py [--workers N]

Triggered automatically by import_to_db.py; can also be run via trigger_matches.py.

# SQL factories — one helper per record type generates both pair_once and full
# variants.  The only structural difference between modes:
#
#   pair_once=True  → b2.contributor > :contrib   (process each pair once)
#                     DELETE WHERE owner = :contrib
#                     INSERT stores BOTH A→B and B→A (UNION ALL), owner = :contrib
#
#   pair_once=False → b2.contributor != :contrib  (compare against every other)
#                     DELETE WHERE contributor_a = :contrib OR contributor_b = :contrib
#                     INSERT also stores both directions so the API can query either way
#
# Why both modes? --all uses pair_once for a 2x speedup: N*(N-1)/2 trigram JOINs
# instead of N*(N-1).  --contributor uses full mode so a single reprocessed
# contributor correctly replaces all its stale matches regardless of alphabetical
# order.
